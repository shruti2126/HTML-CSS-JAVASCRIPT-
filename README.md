- The BBC (bbc.html) webpage is a dummy webpage made using CSS and HTML. 
- index.html is another more basic dummy webpage.
- test_your_reactions.html is a Reaction timer - a simple game that allows you to test how quickly you can react to what you see on the screen.
    Step 1: Type in how many tries you would like to use.
    Step 2: Click on the shapes that appear as quickly as you can.
    Step 3: Your average reaction time will appear on screen after you have exhausted the given number of tries.
- webpage-with-bootstrap is a dummy webpage created using components of the bootrap 5 framework. I have used the jumbotron class for the introduction, the navbar class for the top bar and the card class for the middle section. I have primarily used HTML, CSS and JQuery to create this page. The "AppLandingPage.html" is the file you need to open in your browser to view the page. Or you can simply download the zip folder onto your system, extract files and then open the html page in your browser.
